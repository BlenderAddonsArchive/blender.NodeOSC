# NodeOSC
OSC support for nodes and general usage.

## Usage
I think it is now fairly self explanatory. However, if you have questions please make an issue. This helps me to see where I should focus on the docs...

see the [wiki](https://github.com/maybites/blender.NodeOSC/wiki) for more info (to come...)

inspired by and code used from http://www.jpfep.net/pages/addosc/.

NodeOSC relies on 

* the pure [python module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-osc/) [python-osc](https://github.com/attwad/python-osc) (by Attwad).
* the [pyliblo wrapper](http://das.nasophon.de/pyliblo/) for [liblo](http://liblo.sourceforge.net/) OSC library.



the addon contains the compiled pyliblo wrapper for windows and OSX, but not for linux.
